# JS-Projects

This repository contains various JavaScript projects that I have created to enhance my skills and understanding of web development. Each project is stored in a separate folder within the `JS` directory.

## Projects

### Calculator
A simple calculator built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project was created as part of my learning journey through the [Frontend Masters](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/web-development-v3/javascript-project-setup-event-handling/) course.

#### Project Structure
```
JS/
  └─ calculator/
       ├─ calc.html
       ├─ calc.css
       └─ calc.js
```

#### How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/LousyCake/JS-Projects.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the calculator project directory:
   ```bash
   cd JS-Projects/JS/calculator
   ```
3. Open `calc.html` in your preferred web browser to view and interact with the calculator.

## Future Projects
I will be adding new projects to this repository as I continue to learn and experiment with JavaScript. Stay tuned for more updates!
